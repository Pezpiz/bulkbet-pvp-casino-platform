## Whats this
Simple pvp platform with Telegram login and what not, you can make jackpots coinflips etc the usual. It's a bit old but should work very clean, using bootstrap.


## Footnote
Unfortenantly due to pissing off [Softswiss.com](https://softswiss.com) this project never seen daylight, however the idea I've noted down below and maybe someone else can pick this up.

You can find more shit on respins.io or just simply by search 'softswiss' on github as usually I put this within a readme or whatever, so you can find other snippets all regarding casino shit.

F.e. mondogaming.eu etc. all those can be found.

Hopefully at some point @Ivan-Montik will man up and let me work for them while also stop hacking & bugging my pc's, but this is unlikely so feel free to use for whatever reason.
